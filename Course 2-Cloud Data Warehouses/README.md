* Compare columnar vs. row-oriented approaches
* Implement columnar vs. row-oriented approaches

## Lesson 2 - ELT and Data Warehouse Technology in the Cloud
Learn about ELT, the differences between ETL and ELT, and general cloud data warehouse technologies.
* Explain the differences between ETL and ELT
* Differentiate scenarios where ELT is preferred over ETL
* Implement ETL for OLAP Transformations with SQL
* Select appropriate cloud data storage solutions 
* Select appropriate cloud pipeline solutions 
* Select appropriate cloud data warehouse solutions 

## Lesson 3 - AWS Data Technologies
Learn about AWS Services and how to set up Amazon S3, IAM, VPC, EC2, and RDS. Build a Redshift data warehouse cluster and learn how to interact with it.
* Describe AWS data warehouse services and technologies 
* Create and configure AWS Storage Resources
